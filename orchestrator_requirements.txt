# Add any other core FastAPI dependencies if not covered by fastapi itself,
# or specific utilities *directly used by the Orchestrator's code*.
# For example, if your Orchestrator parses specific JSON schemas, you might need:
# pydantic
# dataclasses-json
# If the Orchestrator directly uses Google AI client library (not just via LangChain):
# google-generativeai
# google-api-core
# googleapis-common-protos
# protobuf
# google-auth
# etc. (Be careful here, often LangChain pulls these)

# If the Orchestrator needs to speak directly to specific agents (e.g. if it calls them via client libraries instead of HTTP):
# For a typical HTTP-based microservice, you generally don't need all agent-specific heavy libs here.
# The Orchestrator's job is to route and combine, not execute ML models itself.
