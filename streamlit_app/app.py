    **To run this application (locally with backend agents):**
    1.  Ensure all backend microservices (API Agent, Retriever Agent, Analysis Agent, Scraping Agent, STT Agent, TTS Agent) are running on their specified ports.
    2.  Start the Orchestrator microservice (`orchestrator/main.py`) on `http://localhost:8000`.
    3.  Set a local environment variable (e.g., in a .streamlit/secrets.toml file if using Streamlit's local secrets management) or directly in code for local testing: `ORCHESTRATOR_URL = "http://localhost:8000"`
    4.  In your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory and run: `streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py`

    **For Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud):**
    1.  Deploy your Orchestrator microservice and other backend agents to a cloud platform (e.g., Render). Get their public/internal URLs.
    2.  In Streamlit Community Cloud settings for this app, go to "Secrets".
    3.  Add `ORCHESTRATOR_URL = "https://your-orchestrator-url.onrender.com"` (replace with your actual URL).
